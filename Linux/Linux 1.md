- `openssl passwd -5 abc123` -> generate hashed passwd
- Command substitution -> $(command)
- 3 methods to change user group -> usermod, groupmems, gpasswd.
- `gpasswd` with options (-a add, -d delete, -m set specific user, -A set admin for group)
- to change group passwd -> `gpasswd (grp_name)`
- password verification (salt value + password = hash)
- `groupmems`                       (group name)
	- -a add user
	- -d delete user
	- -l list users of group

- prevent user access
	- 1- lock user -> `usermod -L (username)`.. to unlock -> `usermod -U (username)` ..this method is not completely locked as user can login SSH
	- 2- change shell -> `usermod -s /sbin/nologin`
	- in etc/shadow if the field of last day of password changed = 0, it has special meaning as user has to change the password -> `chage -d 0 (username)`
- Change defaults configuration for useradd command
	- usedadd -D .... nano /etc/default/useadd
	- login.dfs file has some default options for useradd command
		- CREATE_HOME
			- YES -> it will create home dir for the user with same name (-M to prevent making home dir, it is create but it will not be found under /home)
			- NO -> it will NOT create home dir for the user with same name (-m to make home dir)
			- USERGROUPS_ENAB
				- YES -> will create group with the same name of the user, to prevent the system from making group with same name we use -N
				- NO -> will not create group with the username and will make the primary group of the user = users(100), to let the system make group with same name in this situation we use -U
- When we make pipelines the output is redirected as an input to the next command `head -n10 /etc//passwd | tail -n3`.
- what if we need to save the output of the first command, we use `tee`, `head -n10 /etc//passwd | tee file1.txt | tail -n3`.
- to append to the file we use option `-a` with `tee`.
- search for file location `find`, `locate`, `grep` with their options.
- `find` with permission, time, user, group ,not, or, and.
	- `find -perm 222` -> exact permissions
	- `find -perm -222` -> permissions for everyone
	- `find -perm /222` -> permissions for anyone
	- `find / -name *.mp3 -delete` -> find and delete
	- `find / -name *.mp3 -exec [command] {} \;` -> execute command on result of the find.
- `xargs` reads the stout and gives it as stdin for next command in pipeline
- `\` scape character.
- `sort` is used to sort file based on criteria `sort -t[number] -k[start],[end] n|r|u|h|o|f`
	- n -> sort based on numbers
	- r -> sort reverse
	- u -> sort and unique values
	- o -> sort and redirect on file `sort -t: -k3,3n -o sorted_file /etc/passwd`
	- f -> sort and ignore the case-sensitivity
