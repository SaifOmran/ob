- `openssl passwd -5 abc123` -> generate hashed passwd
- Command substitution -> $(command)
- 3 methods to change user group -> usermod, groupmems, gpasswd.
- `gpasswd` with options (-a add, -d delete, -m set specific user, -A set admin for group)
- to change group passwd -> `gpasswd (grp_name)`
- password verification (salt value + password = hash)
- `groupmems`                       (group name)
	- -a add user
	- -d delete user
	- -l list users of group

- prevent user access
	- 1- lock user -> `usermod -L (username)`.. to unlock -> `usermod -U (username)` ..this method is not completely locked as user can login SSH
	- 2- change shell -> `usermod -s /sbin/nologin`
	- in etc/shadow if the field of last day of password changed = 0, it has special meaning as user has to change the password -> `chage -d 0 (username)`
- Change defaults configuration for useradd command
	- usedadd -D .... nano /etc/default/useadd
	- login.dfs file has some default options for useradd command
		- CREATE_HOME
			- YES -> it will create home dir for the user with same name (-M to prevent making home dir, it is create but it will not be found under /home)
			- NO -> it will NOT create home dir for the user with same name (-m to make home dir)
			- USERGROUPS_ENAB
				- YES -> will create group with the same name of the user, to prevent the system from making group with same name we use -N
				- NO -> will not create group with the username and will make the primary group of the user = users(100), to let the system make group with same name in this situation we use -U
